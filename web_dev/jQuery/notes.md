To learn jQuery I used a combonation of The Definitive Javascript guide by David Flanagan and code academy

The definitive guide goes very indepth, while code academy just gives you the basics of the keystrokes to make things happen 

to get things to sink in quickly and effectively i found that using a simple rescource like CA that uses basic english to explain the topic initialy and then to use a more indepth dictionary type resource such as the definitive guide to undertsand the ins and out of a new technology

when i initially started i tried to start with the book but it was too clunky and hard to understand, CA gives a good introduction to the topic to then do futher reaserch on understanding everything about a topic
