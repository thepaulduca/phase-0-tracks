# Git Definitions

Here is my minor change Mr.Teacher man.

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control, allows a programer, or team of programers to edit or add to a project while holding a previous copy of the project in tact

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a project/file. It allows for an engineer to work without worrying about the consequence because he is not effecting the orginal file. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

a commit is when you merge two branches together and add the edits or additions you have made to the orginal

a good commit message makes it clear what has changed about the file/project

* What is a merge conflict?

a merge conflict is when you changed the same part of the file differently that you are merging together
